			"info": "Where fell running meets open water swimming, and sanity takes a vacation! This 42-mile adventure in the Lake District isn’t just a test of endurance; it’s a way to fully question your life choices. With 13 summits, nearly 10,000 feet of ascent, and four lake swims, this route will make you wish you’d just stayed home with a hot chocolate. But hey, if you’re into swimming, scrambling up mountains, and getting some weird looks from sheep, then the Frog Graham Round might just be the wild day out you’ve been looking for! Grab your gear, bring your sense of humor, and prepare to brag about this one for years.",
